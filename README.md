# Scaffoldinator

Scaffoldinator is just a play place to build a somewhat Ansible / puppet like config management tool.

Note that I have no intention of actually building something Prod-ready. This is just a playground.

## Requirements

To use it, you need to have ruby installed, together and bundler:

    gem install bundler
